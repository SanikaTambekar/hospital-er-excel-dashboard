## ⚠️ Challenges Faced During Analysis

1. **📉 Inconsistent Data Entries**
   Some records had missing or inconsistent age values, making it difficult to categorize age groups accurately. Power Query and logical formulas were used to clean and impute the data.
2. **🧮 Complex Age Grouping Logic**
   Creating accurate age group buckets required deeply nested conditional formulas. Ensuring correctness was key to demographic analysis.
3. **📊 Balancing Visual Simplicity with Depth**
   Designing a layout that was both clear and insightful took multiple iterations. The challenge was to avoid clutter while retaining analytical depth.
4. **📆 Monthly Filtering Accuracy**
   Configuring the slicers and pivot filters to reflect only the selected month’s data needed careful planning, especially for charts and KPI visuals.
